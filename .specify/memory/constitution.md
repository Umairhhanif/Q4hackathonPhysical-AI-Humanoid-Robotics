# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution
<!-- Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation with Embedded RAG Chatbot -->

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy through Primary Source Verification
All statements on robotics, physical AI systems, humanoid design, control architectures, perception models, embodied cognition, and agentic AI must be validated against authoritative primary sources.

### II. Clarity for an Academic Audience
Writing must be accessible to CS learners, robotics engineers, and AI practitioners, with focus on conceptual precision, technical depth, and unambiguous terminology.

### III. Reproducibility
All technical claims, algorithms, architectures, and implementation steps must be fully reproducible. All citations must be traceable.

### IV. Rigor
Claims involving physical AI, robotics locomotion, humanoid control, multi-agent systems, and agent cognition must rely primarily on peer-reviewed papers, reputable academic texts, and industry standards.

## Standards & Constraints

### Traceability & Citation
- Every factual statement must connect to a citable source.
- All references and in-text citations must follow APA 7 style.

### Source Composition
- At least 50% of the total sources must be peer-reviewed publications.
- Minimum 15 authoritative sources required.

### Plagiarism & Integrity
- Zero-tolerance policy for plagiarism.
- All content must pass a plagiarism scan (Score = 0%) prior to finalization.

### Writing & Format
- Flesch-Kincaid grade 10–12 readability.
- Word Count: 5,000–7,000 words total.
- Output: PDF with embedded citations and Docusaurus-compatible page structure.

### Technical Integration
- Content must be compatible with Docusaurus format and push-ready for GitHub Pages deployment.
- Chapters must be structured to support accurate RAG retrieval.
- Chatbot must respond strictly based on book text or user-highlighted text.

## Governance

This constitution defines the authoritative standards for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project. All contributions must adhere to these principles.

### Amendment Process
Amendments require documentation of the change, rationale, and impact analysis. Version numbers must be incremented according to semantic versioning rules.

### Compliance
All chapters and code artifacts will be reviewed against these principles.
- Verification Pass: All claims validated.
- Technical Accuracy Review: Robotics correctness checked.
- Reproducibility Review: Designs replicable by CS background readers.
