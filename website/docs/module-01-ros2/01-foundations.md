# Physical AI Foundations

Physical Artificial Intelligence (PAI) refers to the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, where algorithms control physical bodies to interact with the real world. Unlike purely digital AI, which operates in the realm of bits (images, text, code), Physical AI must deal with the constraints of atoms—gravity, friction, inertia, and uncertainty.

## The Embodiment Hypothesis

The embodiment hypothesis posits that intelligence emerges from the interaction of an agent with its environment [@pfeifer2006body]. A physical body is not just a puppet for the mind; it shapes the way the mind learns and processes information.

### Key Concepts

1.  **Actuation**: The conversion of energy into motion.
2.  **Sensing**: The perception of the physical state.
3.  **Control**: The algorithmic regulation of the system.

## From Digital to Physical

Transitioning from Large Language Models (LLMs) to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models requires grounding. The tokens of an LLM must map to physical actions (torque, velocity, position).

## Challenges

*   **Sim-to-Real Gap**: Simulation is perfect; reality is messy.
*   **Safety**: Hallucinating text is annoying; hallucinating a robot arm trajectory is dangerous.
*   **Energy Efficiency**: Brains run on ~20W; GPUs run on ~300W.
